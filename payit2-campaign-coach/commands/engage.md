Manage supporter engagement for your campaign: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this workflow:

1. **Identify the Action**: Use the campaign-context skill to establish campaign type, then ask what the organizer wants to do:
   - **Thank supporters** (donors / attendees / members who paid)
   - **Post a campaign update** (milestone, story update, impact report)
   - **Re-engage lapsed supporters** (bring back dormant donors, reach non-attendees, follow up with unpaid members)
   - **Ask for shares** (turn supporters into advocates)

2. **Gather What's Needed for the Action**:

   **Use MCP tools first** — don't ask the organizer for data you can fetch:
   - For thank-yous: Call `list_supporters` to get actual names, amounts, and payment status. For a specific person, use `search_supporters(name_or_email)`.
   - For group re-engagement: Call `get_payment_summary` to see exactly who has and hasn't paid, and the payment breakdown.
   - For updates: Call `get_campaign_stats` for current progress numbers.

   **Only ask if MCP is unavailable:**
   - For thank-yous: How many people? Do you have names and amounts? What channel (email, text, social, in-campaign post)?
   - For updates: What milestone or news? What's the current progress?
   - For re-engagement: How long since last activity? What's the situation now?
   - For share asks: Who are you asking — donors, attendees, or members?

3. **Generate Personalized Messages**: Adapt by type and action:

   **Thank supporters:**
   - Fundraiser: Tier-appropriate messages (micro $1-25, standard $26-100, major $101-500, anchor $500+)
   - Event: Attendee confirmation + excitement builder
   - Group: Payment acknowledgment + progress update

   **Post update:**
   - Fundraiser: Milestone structure (25%, 50%, 75%, goal) — use update content framework
   - Event: Lineup reveal, logistics update, "can't wait to see you" energy
   - Group: Progress tally ("12 of 20 paid"), deadline context

   **Re-engage:**
   - Fundraiser: Story update for lapsed donors, gentle share request
   - Event: Last-chance message for attendees who haven't registered
   - Group: Private 1:1 follow-up for unpaid members (Friendly Collector principles — never public, never accusatory)

   **Ask for shares:**
   - All types: Pre-written share content they can copy-paste, co-organizer invitation, challenge format

   If generating for multiple people, dispatch the supporter-outreach agent for batch personalization.

4. **Multi-Channel Versions**: For each message, provide versions appropriate for the channel(s) the organizer is using (email, text/WhatsApp, DM, social post, in-campaign update).

5. **Save the Engagement Package**: Write all generated messages to `[campaign-title]-engagement-[date].md` in the workspace, organized by recipient or action type.
