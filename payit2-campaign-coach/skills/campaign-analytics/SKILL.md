# Campaign Analytics

Diagnose campaign health, identify bottlenecks, and prescribe specific actions — for fundraisers, events, and groups. This skill turns raw campaign data into actionable coaching.

## Health Score Formula

Calculate a 0-100 health score using type-specific weights:

### Fundraiser Weights
| Factor | Weight | What to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Momentum | 25% | Donation velocity vs. >2/day target in week 1 |
| Social reach | 20% | Shares, unique visitors, share-to-visit ratio |
| Story quality | 15% | Description length, photo present, video present, title strength |
| Donor engagement | 15% | Thank-you rate, update frequency, donor return rate |
| Goal progress | 15% | % of goal reached vs. days active |
| Network activation | 10% | Co-organizer count, email list usage, channel diversity |

### Event Weights
| Factor | Weight | What to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Registration velocity | 25% | % of capacity sold per week (healthy: 10-15%/week) |
| Capacity utilization | 20% | % of total capacity sold (target 80%+ by event date) |
| Promotion reach | 20% | Channels active, partner cross-promotion, share rate |
| Engagement | 15% | Attendee-to-sharer ratio (target: 1 in 5 attendees shares) |
| Revenue | 10% | Revenue vs. break-even vs. goal |
| Logistics readiness | 10% | Communication cadence, confirmation emails set up |

### Group Weights
| Factor | Weight | What to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Payment rate | 30% | % of group that has paid (target: 80%+ by deadline) |
| Deadline proximity | 20% | Days remaining vs. payment rate (are you on pace?) |
| Communication cadence | 20% | Reminder timing following Friendly Collector framework |
| Response rate | 15% | % who respond to messages (even "I'll pay soon" counts) |
| Transparency | 15% | Cost breakdown visible, progress updates shared |

## Score Interpretation (All Types)

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80-100 | Thriving | Maintain cadence, expand to new channels |
| 60-79 | Healthy | Address 1-2 weak areas, increase promotion |
| 40-59 | At risk | Significant changes needed — dispatch campaign-coach agent |
| 20-39 | Critical | Major intervention — dispatch campaign-coach agent |
| 0-19 | Stalled | Consider relaunch or pivot |

## Diagnostic Framework

When an organizer asks "why isn't this working?" run through all 3 stages:

### Stage 1: Traffic Diagnosis
**Question**: Are people seeing the campaign?

- Fundraiser: page views, shares, channel diversity
- Event: registration page visits, social reach, partner posts
- Group: did launch message reach all members?

**If traffic is low**: Problem is promotion, not the page. Reference campaign-promotion skill.

### Stage 2: Conversion Diagnosis
**Question**: Are visitors taking action?

- Fundraiser: visit-to-donation rate (healthy: 5-15%), avg donation $35-75
- Event: visit-to-registration rate (healthy: 15-25%), ticket tier distribution
- Group: payment rate per reminder sent (should increase after each message)

**If traffic is fine but conversion is low**: Problem is the page. Reference campaign-creation skill.

### Stage 3: Engagement Diagnosis
**Question**: Are supporters becoming advocates?

- Fundraiser: donor-to-sharer ratio (target >15%), update frequency
- Event: attendee-to-sharer ratio (target: 1 in 5), re-share content posted
- Group: did paying members bring peer pressure? Are unpaid members responding to reminders?

**If conversion is fine but growth has stalled**: Problem is engagement loop. Reference supporter-engagement skill.

## Type-Specific KPIs

### Fundraiser KPIs
| KPI | Formula | Target |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Donation velocity | Donations per day | >2/day in week 1 |
| Share rate | Shares / page views | >5% |
| Conversion rate | Donations / unique visitors | 5-15% |
| Average donation | Total raised / donor count | $35-$75 |
| Donor-to-sharer ratio | Sharers / donors | >15% |
| Update frequency | Updates / weeks active | >1/week |
| Time to first donation | Hours from launch to first gift | <4 hours |

### Event KPIs
| KPI | Healthy Range | Warning Sign |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Registration velocity | 10-15% of capacity/week | <5% after launch week |
| Capacity utilization | On track to 80%+ by event | <50% at midpoint |
| Early bird conversion | 25-35% of total tickets | <15% |
| Ticket tier distribution | Even spread across tiers | >80% in cheapest tier |
| Attendee share rate | 1 in 5 attendees shares | <1 in 10 |
| Email open rate | 40-60% | <25% |

### Group KPIs
| KPI | Healthy | Warning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Payment rate at midpoint | >50% paid | <30% paid |
| Payment rate at deadline | >80% paid | <60% paid |
| Response rate to messages | >70% (paid or acknowledged) | <40% |
| Days to full collection | 2-3 weeks from launch | >4 weeks with <80% paid |

## Optimization Playbook by Effort

### Quick Wins (do today — all types)
- **Fundraiser**: Add/improve primary photo, shorten description to <150 words, add co-organizer, thank unthanked donors, post one update
- **Event**: Post urgency content (seats remaining, days left), send reminder to opened-but-didn't-register email segment, update hero image
- **Group**: Send a progress update to the group, privately follow up with 1-2 unpaid members

### Medium Effort (this week)
- **Fundraiser**: Record and upload video (4x more funds), send personalized emails to top 20 contacts, create content for 3+ social channels
- **Event**: Activate partner cross-promotion, create social proof content ("X attendees registered"), launch group discount offer
- **Collection**: Add a co-collector, extend deadline with real-constraint framing, restructure payment tier if response is concentrated in one option

### Strategic Moves (campaign is stalled)
- **Fundraiser**: Rewrite title (test 3 options), refresh full description, pitch local media
- **Event**: Consider price adjustment, add a new tier, reach out to complementary organizations for cross-promotion
- **Group**: One-on-one outreach to every unpaid member, consider scope reduction to match actual payment rate
