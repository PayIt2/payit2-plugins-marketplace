  Shared context-gathering engine used by all Campaign Coach commands. Use when
  starting any campaign interaction to determine campaign type and collect the
  minimum information needed for the current task. Triggers automatically at the
  start of every /campaign, /promote, /check-in, and /engage command.

# Campaign Context

Gather the minimum context needed for the current command through natural conversation. Never ask for more than what the current task requires.

## Context Model

| Field | Needed By | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Campaign type (fundraiser / event / group) | All commands | Always required first |
| Title | All commands | Required |
| URL (if live) | /promote, /check-in, /engage | Optional — extract what you can from URL structure |
| Goal / target amount | /campaign, /check-in | Required for fundraiser and group |
| Ticket types / pricing | /campaign, /check-in | Required for events |
| Current progress (amount raised / tickets sold / payments received) | /check-in, /engage | Required for check-in |
| Days active / days until deadline or event | /check-in, /promote | Required for check-in |
| Audience description | /promote, /campaign | Optional |
| Channels used so far | /promote, /check-in | Optional |
| Group size | /campaign, /check-in | Required for group campaigns |

## MCP-First Data Gathering

When the PayIt2 MCP server is available, use it to eliminate manual questions:

1. **If the organizer provides a URL or campaign ID**, call `get_campaign` immediately to pre-fill: type, title, goal, current stats, and timeline. Do not ask for data already returned.
2. **For /check-in**, also call `get_campaign_stats` for financial detail and `get_campaign_activity` to see the last 30 events — recent activity tells you whether the campaign has momentum or has stalled.
3. **Cross-session memory**: At the start of any coaching command, call `get_conversation_history` for the campaign. If a session exists from the past 7 days, open with: "Last time we talked about [key recommendation] — have you had a chance to try that?" before diving into new analysis.
4. **Only ask the organizer to fill gaps** — information not returned by MCP tools. Never re-ask data already fetched.
5. **Fallback**: If MCP is unavailable (no API key configured), proceed with the manual question flow below.

## Context-Gathering Rules

1. **Type first.** Always establish campaign type before asking anything else. Ask: "What are you working on — a fundraiser, an event, or a group?"

2. **Minimum viable context.** Ask only what the current command needs. /promote needs type + title + what's been tried. /engage needs type + what action the user wants to take. Don't ask for a full data dump.

3. **Accept a URL shortcut.** If the user provides a PayIt2 page URL, acknowledge it and ask for the 1-2 things the URL can't tell you (e.g., current progress stats for /check-in).

4. **Use what's in the conversation.** If campaign type and title were established earlier in the conversation, don't ask again. Reference what you already know: "Got it — continuing with your [title] [type]."

5. **One question at a time.** Never ask multiple questions in one message. Pick the most important unknown and ask just that.

## Context Questions by Command

### /campaign (Create & Launch)
Required: campaign type, then branch into type-specific story interview (see campaign-creation skill).

### /promote (Drive Traffic)
Ask in order, stopping when you have enough:
1. "Tell me about your campaign — what type is it and what's the title?"
2. "Do you have a PayIt2 URL for it yet?"
3. "How long has it been live and what promotion have you tried so far?"

### /check-in (Health Check)
Ask in order:
1. "What type of campaign is it and what's the title?"
2. Then by type:
   - **Fundraiser:** "Share your current numbers — amount raised, number of donors, and how many days it's been live."
   - **Event:** "Share your numbers — tickets sold, total capacity, and how many days until the event."
   - **Group:** "Share your numbers — how many members have paid, total group size, and days until the deadline."
3. "What channels have you been using to promote it?"

### /engage (Supporter Relationships)
1. "What type of campaign is it?"
2. "What would you like to do — thank supporters, post an update, re-engage lapsed supporters, or ask for shares?"
3. Follow up with only what's needed for that action.
